Explanation:

Logger Class:

Singleton Instance: A private static variable single_instance is used to hold the single instance of the class.
Private Constructor: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation.
getInstance Method: This static method returns the single instance of the Logger class. The method is thread-safe by using double-checked locking.
log Method: A simple method to log messages, here it just prints the message to the console.

Main Class:

Get Logger Instance: The getInstance method is called to get the single instance of the Logger.
Log Messages: The log method is called to log messages.
Benefits of Singleton Pattern in Logging:
Single Point of Control: Ensures that all logging operations are handled by a single instance.
Resource Management: Prevents the creation of multiple instances, which could lead to resource wastage.
Global Access: The Singleton instance is globally accessible, making it easy to use throughout the application.
This implementation ensures that the Logger instance is created only when it is needed and only once, thus adhering to the Singleton design pattern principles.
