To design and implement a music streaming application that plays music from various sources using the Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator design patterns, we need to break down the requirements and address each design pattern individually.

Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern allows different music sources (local files, online streaming services, radio stations) to be adapted to a common interface. This makes it easier to integrate new music sources without changing the client code.

Bridge Pattern
The Bridge Pattern decouples the music playback functionality from the music source, allowing us to change the abstraction (music playback) and its implementation (music sources) independently.

Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern allows us to add additional features (e.g., equalizer, volume control) to the music playback dynamically.
Implementation
Let's start by defining the common interface for music sources.

Step 1: Common Interface for Music Sources
// MusicSource.java
Step 2: Concrete Music Sources
// LocalFileMusicSource.java

// OnlineStreamingMusicSource.java

// RadioStationMusicSource.java
Step 3: Bridge Pattern - Music Player Abstraction
// MusicPlayer.java

// AdvancedMusicPlayer.java

Step 4: Decorator Pattern - Additional Features
// MusicPlayerDecorator.java

// EqualizerDecorator.java

// VolumeControlDecorator.java

Step 5: Main Class to Demonstrate the Application

Explanation
Adapter Pattern: We created different music source classes (LocalFileMusicSource, OnlineStreamingMusicSource, RadioStationMusicSource) that implement the MusicSource interface.
Bridge Pattern: The MusicPlayer abstraction is decoupled from the MusicSource implementation, allowing different music players to use different music sources independently.
Decorator Pattern: Additional features (equalizer and volume control) are added to the MusicPlayer using decorators (EqualizerDecorator, VolumeControlDecorator).
This design ensures that the application is flexible, scalable, and maintainable, allowing easy addition of new music sources, playback features, and modifications without affecting existing code.
